GROMACS:      gmx grompp, version 2016.1
Executable:   /sw/sdev/Modules/gromacs/gromacs-2016.1/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /sw/sdev/Modules/gromacs/gromacs-2016.1
Working dir:  /work/pousaneh/Field-Big/0.266/a1/V9
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f NVT_vis.mdp -c NVT_F.gro -p topol.top -o NVT_vis.tpr -maxwarn 3 -t NVT_F.cpt

Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'

Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.1#

NOTE 1 [file NVT_vis.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated since GROMACS 5.0 and will be
  removed in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for
  the verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.


NOTE 2 [file NVT_vis.mdp]:
  The Berendsen thermostat does not generate the correct kinetic energy
  distribution. You might want to consider using the V-rescale thermostat.

Setting the LD random seed to 1320576748
Generated 531 of the 2016 non-bonded parameter combinations
Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'CO2'
Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 29997.00
Reading Coordinates, Velocities and Box size from old trajectory
Will read whole trajectory
Last frame         -1 time 200000.000   
Using frame at t = 200000 ps
Starting time for run is 0 ps
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.84

NOTE 3 [file NVT_vis.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.



NOTE 4 [file NVT_vis.mdp]:
  This run will generate roughly 412000 Mb of data

The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

NOTE: This file uses the deprecated 'group' cutoff_scheme. This will be
removed in a future release when 'verlet' supports all interaction forms.


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
