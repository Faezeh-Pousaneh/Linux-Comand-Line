GROMACS:      gmx grompp, version 2016.1
Executable:   /sw/sdev/Modules/gromacs/gromacs-2016.1/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /sw/sdev/Modules/gromacs/gromacs-2016.1
Working dir:  /work/pousaneh/Field-Big/0.266/a1/V8
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f NVT_F.mdp -c NVT.gro -p topol.top -o NVT_F.tpr -maxwarn 3 -t NVT.cpt

Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'

Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.1#

NOTE 1 [file NVT_F.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated since GROMACS 5.0 and will be
  removed in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for
  the verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.

Setting the LD random seed to 1240076192
Generated 531 of the 2016 non-bonded parameter combinations
Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'CO2'
Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 29997.00
Reading Coordinates, Velocities and Box size from old trajectory
Will read whole trajectory
Last frame         -1 time 1105555.000   
Using frame at t = 1.10556e+06 ps
Starting time for run is 0 ps
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.52

NOTE 2 [file NVT_F.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.



There were 2 notes

Back Off! I just backed up NVT_F.log to ./#NVT_F.log.1#

Running on 2 nodes with total 32 cores, 64 logical cores
  Cores per node:           16
  Logical cores per node:   32
Hardware detected on host r3i7n16 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.60GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_256

  Hardware topology: Basic


The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

Reading file NVT_F.tpr, VERSION 2016.1 (single precision)
The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1

Will use 16 particle-particle and 16 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 32 MPI processes


NOTE: This file uses the deprecated 'group' cutoff_scheme. This will be
removed in a future release when 'verlet' supports all interaction forms.


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
